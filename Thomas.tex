\noindent{}In spring 2015, Lydia Pintscher started the initiative ``Evolving KDE'' with the goal of ``helping KDE and KDE e.V. get a better understanding of where we are, where we want to go and how we want to get there''. One of the central actions of this initiative was to run a survey asking members of the KDE community why they are part of it, what they want to achieve and what they think is currently missing.

One important result of that survey was that many in the community felt a lack of a common Vision driving KDE forward. To fix that, a group of people formed during Akademy to write a Vision draft for KDE. The team collected a lot of ideas and went through several iterations of a Vision draft. However, around the end of the year, the process was a bit stuck. The team was unsure about the scope the Vision should have (should they immediately go for a Vision for all of KDE or start with one for the KDE e.V. first?) and whether the whole community could ever agree on a single Vision in the first place.

Andrew Lake, who had supported the team with his experience in Vision creation, had just started a new, very demanding job and could not find the time to drive the project forward anymore. Since I was still convinced that a Vision was crucial for KDE, I took over that support role. Discussions with the team showed that at first, we had to decide whether we want a Vision or a Mission for KDE. In the end, we decided that we needed both: A Vision to define what we want the future to be like, and a Mission to determine how we want to get there.

With that settled, we agreed on a first draft for a Vision and opened the discussion with the rest of the community. Pretty quickly, two groups formed within those joining the discussion: One group (which included the original drafting group) wanted the Vision to focus more on overarching goals like freedom and privacy for software users. The other group wanted the Vision to focus more on practical aspects like client software written in Qt, and created a counter-proposal to our Vision draft.

After long and heated debates and more and more tension building up between the two groups, we came to a realization: The world we wanted to live in was actually the same, what we disagreed on was just how to get there. With that realization, we decided that we should postpone the debate about the means for the moment, and first express our shared goals.

From this point on, it all went much easier, and after a few more iterations, the discussion converged onto a Vision which everyone who participated in the discussion agreed with: What KDE wants is
\begin{quote}
 A world in which everyone has control over their digital life and enjoys freedom and privacy.
\end{quote}
Glad that we had put our differences behind us for the moment, we published our Vision. The article with which we published it already hinted at the next step that we'd need to take: Writing a Mission statement describing how we want to work towards our Vision.

The Vision as such was received very positively, but since it is - purposefully - vague, people were eager to know what it means in practice. To answer that question, we set out to create a Mission statement. Since we had merely postponed discussing the differences in the community regarding the ``how'' to the Mission discussion, I had feared that these differences would now bubble up again. To my surprise, this did not really happen. It turned out that once we had agreed on the ``what'', when it came to the ``how'', the differences weren't as big as we expected. We agreed on many aspects of our Mission, yet there were many important details where we disagreed. The problem was that far fewer people participated in the Mission discussion than in the Vision discussion during its most active phase.

In the end, the differences often boiled down to ``your opinion against mine''. Since individual opinions can hardly be a good basis for a Mission which guides a whole community, I wanted to give everyone in the community a chance to voice their opinion on the points we already agreed on, and especially on the ones which were still debated, so I did what more then a decade of research training and experience had taught me: I set up an online survey. Since the Mission has to come from the community, of course that was the main target population for the survey. I also opened the survey to the outside world (capturing for each participant whether they are users of KDE software or active contributors to KDE), however, so that we can also see whether the community's priorities align with our users'.

Now we have 200 responses from (current or former) contributors, and almost 1200 responses from users, so we have a pretty good picture of what is important to both the contributors and interested users.

When the results are analyzed, they will feed back into our Mission statement which we want to have published well before QtCon in the beginning of September.

In the meantime, it delights me to see that the Vision is already used in practice: KDE contributors as well as users have used it on various occasions to remind us of the values that KDE stands for, which is exactly the purpose of a Vision. Even though the road to the Vision was rocky, this shows that it was worth it!
