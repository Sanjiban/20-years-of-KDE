\noindent{}One of the largest International open-source Conferences was organized in India : The KDE Meetup 2013 and conf.kde.in 2014 at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT) in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. It was a platform for the exchange of ideas and thoughts with speakers coming from different cultures, leading to an advancement in the essence of open-source development and reliving the joys of contributing in KDE. Both the events were a huge phenomenon in itself with the participation of over 350 students from the far ends of the country such as Delhi, Durgapur, Mumbai and many more. 

It was my dream to host something at a scale like this in Gujarat. People in our state were not aware about FOSS. With over 150 engineering colleges, there was a huge opportunity to introduce them to the world of contributing to FOSS. When my colleagues and I first started planning the event, we never imagined that we will receive so much support from across India and indeed from around the world. We never thought in our wildest dreams that we might attract amazing group of developers and Open source Enthusiasts from more than 9 states of the country. Both the conferences served for a perfect environment for getting people to know about KDE and open-source software development in general. The expert KDE Contributors flew from different parts of India, Europe and USA to talk about KDE Applications, introducing the audience to KDE and open-source tools and technologies and answer the queries. 

One thing that we experienced that International conferences such as these serve as the perfect arena for students to get involved with open source and to get themselves acquainted with the way communities such as KDE function. It is the perfect opportunity to interact with these mentors and members who can guide them along and also help them to participate in various coding mentoring programs such as Google Summer of Code and Season of KDE. Students get to collaborate with them and also build upon their own ideas and create new projects of their own as a part of KDE.

One of the major highlights of the event - the Bardoli incident - is an inspiration and an indication of the dedication of the members of the KDE community to spread knowledge among all and to ensure sure that everyone is a part of  the community and that no one feels left out. Many enthusiastic students from Bardoli compromised on their weekends and came from far away places and were all prepped up to make the most of the event. Inspite of traversing a long journey accompanied by fatigue, they did their best to work along with the speakers but somehow it didn’t work out for them and they decided to leave the event. Pradeepto saw them leaving and he sat with all of them and talked personally to each one of them. He convinced them to stay. The next day, special sessions were organized just for them and all of them showed up with renewed. They covered up all that they had missed in a short span of time and were eager to learn more.

Let me give you an insight to the positive things people imbibed from the conference and how the talks changed their way of thinking. This was a Text from a Delegates of conf.kde.in  who traveled 700km to attend it.

``Nobody cares about the people. only wants gathering and all. No one knows what were participants doing. But as we cared a lot by you and your team is really appreciated. Thanks for my side behalf of all participant.''

``\#kdemeetup One thing to learn.. Don’t be scared of coding.''

At the end of the event there was a newfound inspiration within all the participants, they had the desire to contribute, to be a part of the largest and friendliest community in the world. This was a change, a different sort of exposure which the students received which relieved them from the usual drudgery and boredom of college education which doesn’t expose them to real world programming. The event lived up to its aim - helping people know about KDE and to provide them with the basic skills and techniques so that they can contribute to open source. The community speakers were as warm and amiable as they could be and the students were encouraged to approach them and ask as many doubts as they could. This event left the students asking for more. All that they had in their minds was to learn and explore and innovate - create something which could be the next revolution. It gives us motivation to hold such kind of conferences at other places so that young students can benefit more than ever and culture of FOSS keeps thriving in this world.
