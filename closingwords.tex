\chapter*{Closing words}

When I joined the KDE community 10 years ago I could never have imagined how much of an impact it would have on my life. I am where I am today because of the people in KDE and everything I learned from them. I am surely not the only one and I am grateful for it. In a world of rising tension between cultures, countries and people, communities like KDE transcend artificial barriers and make us understand that we are better together than we are apart, that we achieve more when we are united than when we are divided, that our shared interests are bigger than our differences.

This book can only give you a glimpse into the past 20 years of KDE. I hope we still gave you a good overview and explained why our heart is in this community.

To my fellow contributors: May you always stay innovative, smart, open-minded, inclusive, dedicated and awesome. Thank you for being a part of the journey. A lot of amazing things are still ahead of us.

To our users: The past 20 years have shown that there is a lot of technical excellence, pragmatism and will to fight for our users in this community. We will continue on this way - for you.
